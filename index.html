			My name is John Pimenidis and I am currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in order to become a Full Stack Web Developer. By the end of this course I aim to be able to create appealing, professional and of course usable websites. My ultimate goal is to get into the video game world and be able to finally make that perfect game that everyone is waiting for (Half-Life 3 confirmed?).

			When I am not sitting in front of the computer trying to figure out how to survive my next class, you'll find me at the nearest pizzaria. I live in Little Ferry, NJ. I love love to travel and I am looking forward to a new and fulfilling career in coding. Cheers.
